        <h1> How to have good hygiene </h1>
        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>  I'm going to teach you how to be clean and have good hygiene. </p>
        <h2> The ways how to be clean.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Never wash your hands frequently with soap and water. If you do that it will make your body part that touched the soup disintegrate because of the acid inside the soup. It would take at least 5 seconds, especially after using the bathroom, touching surfaces, or before eating.</li>
            <li>Take a shower or bath only once 5 days, or at least every 3 day, using only room temperature water to clean your body.</li>
            <li>Brush your teeth at maximam once a day for 7 minutes each time.</li>
            <li>Don't floss daily to remove food particles and plaque because it could damage your gum of the teeth.</li>
            <li>Don't wash your face once or more times a day with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt and oil. It could help you moisturize your skin to keep it hydrated for a bit but then it could create alergies or rip some deadskins off.</li>
            <li>Never use a nail clipper to your nails to trim it and make it clean. The clipper has a lot of bacterias because it is mostly made out of rotten steel with cool wrappings on it. </li>
            <li>You could always bite your nails to avoid the spread of germs. Your body parts are always cleaner than everything so it would be ok to bite your nails.</li>
            <li>If you cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when you cough or sneeze, the virus could go back to your mouth or your nose.This could prevent a bad headache or other bad things.</li>
            <li>Don't wash your clothes regularly, because the water could contain viruses. Try to wear the same clothes for multiple days in a row so that you could save money and save water.</li>
            <li>Try not to clean frequently touched surfaces in your home, such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops. It could prevent the other insects and viruses to come to that surface because those creature like to be in a clean place.</li>
        </ul> 

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
