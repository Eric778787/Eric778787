            <li>The ingredients are 500g of flour, 2-3 egg, 350ml of milk, 2 spoons of butter, 5 spoons of sugar, half spoon of baking powder and a little bit of salt. </li>
            <li>For a tool, you need a pan or a microwave oven.</li>
            <li>First you have to check if the ingredients are clean.</li> 
            <li>You should crack the egg and stir it.</li> 
            <li>Then you have to melt the butter in a microwave oven.</li>
            <li>When the butter is melted, you have to mix the egg and the butter.</li> 
            <li>If you're done mixing, mix the mixture with the flour, baking powder, milk, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>You now put the dough on the pan in any size you want. When the pancake is brownish you could move the pancake on a plate and add some topping like honey, nutella, berries etc.</li>
